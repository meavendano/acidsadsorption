Overview:
---------
This repository contains the code used for modeling in the manuscript titled "Recovery and Enrichment of Organic Acids from Kraft
Black Liquor by Simulated Moving Bed Adsorption" published in ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. The modeling approach
involves setting the adsorption as a system of partial differential equations in Pyomo â€” Optimization Modeling in Python.The result is
a framework expressed as a non-linear problem (NLP) solved using Ipopt 13.12.

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------
The installation of Pyomo and Ipopt can be done following the guidelines provided in Suzuki and Kawajiri 2021. Refer to the respective documentation for installation details.
